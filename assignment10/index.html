        <h1>Sims 4 Expansion Packs</h1>
        <p>These are two of my favorite expansion packs for Sims 4</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">City Living Expansion Pack</h2>
        <p>This expansion pack brought apartments to the game as well as more activities for your sim to go to. I love the festivals and flea markets, as they added a lot more variety to the game play itself.
            It made it a lot more fun to start off your sim's life as you didn't have to spend all of your money on a house immediately. It also brought a lot of different cultures into the game making it a much more vibrant world.

        <img src="images/cottageliving.jpg" alt="Cottage Living">
        <h2 class="section-title">Cottage Living Expansion Pack</h2>
        <p>I love cottage living for the aesthetic it brought to the game. It brought farming into the game along with a world with a very distinct look which paired with the new furniture and clothing items.
            This expansion pack is perfect for a calm playthrough, raising chickens and llamas and helping your neighbors run errands makes the game feel very homey. I also love the lot challenges such as simple living, which makes it necessary to have food items in your inventory to actually make food.
